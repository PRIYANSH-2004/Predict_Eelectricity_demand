Electricity Demand Forecasting for Kansai Electric Power
Project Overview
This project implements an advanced machine learning solution for forecasting electricity demand within the Kansai Electric Power jurisdiction in Japan. The forecasting model combines sophisticated time series analysis, weather data integration, and ensemble learning techniques to predict hourly electricity consumption patterns throughout 2023.

Technical Approach
The solution employs a comprehensive methodology including:

1. Data Integration & Preprocessing
Historical electricity demand data from Kansai Electric Power
Weather data from multiple locations within the service area
Japanese holiday calendar integration
Temporal feature engineering
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Temporal pattern analysis
Seasonality decomposition
3. Feature Engineering
Rolling statistics
Lag features
Holiday indicators
4. Model Architecture
XGBoost: For capturing complex non-linear relationships
LightGBM: For handling large-scale data with high efficiency
Ensemble weighting: For optimal model combination
